# Gallery Site

A responsive image gallery built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was previously a bit of a private playground for me to dive a bit deeper into CSS Grid, image srcsets, and snap-scrolling. Making it public, I've made a few changes such as ensuring the site follows accessibility standards and (hopefully) works on all types of devices. All images have been sourced under Creative Common licenses.

## Features
- Responsive grid gallery with color-themed slides
- Uses `srcset` for optimized image loading on desktop and mobile
- Accessible markup and keyboard navigation
- Smooth scroll and back-to-top button
- All images sourced under Creative Commons licenses

## Getting Started

1. **View the site:**

2. **Run locally:**
